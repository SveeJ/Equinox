# Equinox
Equinox bot is a real time automations solution built on commission for the Equinox gaming community that works on the discord.js API and allows users 
to directly generate challonge tournaments through the discord server chat and challonge.ts API wrapper allowing them to simulate matchmaking and display 
results of their tournaments publicly. 

## How to run the app
1. Either fork or install the app and open the folder in cli
2. Install all dependencies using `npm i` command
3. Run the app using the app run scripts after changing the bot token to your own discord API bot token to run the bot on your server

## Features
 - Creating a Challonge Tournament
 - Assigning players to the tournament
 - Updating results to the generated tournament
 - Getting new match updates when scores submitted on challonge
 
 ## WARNING
 This project is deprecated now. It runs on old versions of discord.js and challonge API. It was made to be an on commission project for a large gaming 
 community that used it for several of their events and then eventually pivoted to a new system rendering this system no longer essential. Hence, no 
 further work has been done on it and it is now being made public as legacy.
